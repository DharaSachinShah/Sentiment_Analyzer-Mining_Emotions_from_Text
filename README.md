# Sentiment_Analyzer-Mining_Emotions_from_Text

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on real-world text data such as tweets, movie reviews, and product feedback. The goal is to build a machine learning model that classifies text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

Using Python libraries like NLTK, TextBlob, scikit-learn, and pandas, the project demonstrates the full NLP pipeline â€” from text preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to feature extraction and model evaluation.

Key Highlights of the project: 
- Text Cleaning & Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, case normalization, and more.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Discover patterns and sentiment distributions in the dataset.

- Feature Extraction: Convert text to numerical form using Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec.

- Model Training & Evaluation: Train machine learning models and evaluate their performance on sentiment classification tasks.

- Tools & Libraries: Python, Jupyter Notebook, NLTK, TextBlob, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib
